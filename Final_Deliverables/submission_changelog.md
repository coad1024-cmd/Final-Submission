# Submission Version History

| Version | Date | Author | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **v1.0** | Jan 15, 2026 | Research Team | Initial Executive Summary (Draft). Rejected for insufficient technical depth. |
| **v1.1** | Jan 15, 2026 | Research Team | Expanded to "Technical Report". Added detailed Backing Mechanism analysis, Solidity-level architectural descriptions, and direct answers to Challenge prompts. |
| **v1.2** | Jan 15, 2026 | Research Team | Deepened Design and Modelling sections. Added pseudo-code logic for "Tranche" mechanisms and formal mathematical definitions for the De-Peg attack model. |
| **v1.3** | Jan 15, 2026 | Research Team | Replaced pseudo-Solidity with formal logic definitions (Section 4). Corrected deep-link references for Attack Modelling (Section 5). |
| **v1.4** | Jan 15, 2026 | Research Team | **Narrative Overhaul**. integrated artifact insights directly into the report body to create a self-contained "Technical Story." Reduced reliance on external links. |
| **v1.5** | Jan 15, 2026 | Research Team | Added explicit technical analysis of **Liquity V1 (LUSD)** to contrast Static vs Dynamic stability models. |
