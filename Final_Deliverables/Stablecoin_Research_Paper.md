## Abstract

The stablecoin sustainability trilemma refers to the fundamental trade-offs in designing stablecoins, where achieving three key properties—stability, decentralization, and capital efficiency (or scalability)—simultaneously proves challenging, forcing compromises on at least one. By analyzing three distinct architectures—**Sky** (Hybrid RWA), **Liquity** (Crypto-Native), and **Terra** (Algorithmic)—we demonstrate that **Efficiency** and **Solvency** are often inversely correlated in the absence of external revenue. Our research employs a dual-track methodology: (1) **On-Chain Forensics** to evaluate the solvency of live protocols using January 2026 state data; and (2) **Agent-Based Modelling** to independently simulate theoretical de-peg thresholds and attack costs. We find that: (1) Sky has compromised decentralization to solve the "Volume Trap" of negative margins; (2) Liquity V2 utilizes control theory to maximize censorship resistance at the cost of capital flexibility; and (3) Terra’s algorithmic model exhibits a quantifiable "Death Spiral" threshold when the governance token market cap falls below 150% of the stablecoin supply. Crucially, our simulations show that attack profitability scales non-linearly as protocol-owned liquidity targets are undershot. We conclude by proposing two theoretical designs—the "Atomic Wrapper" and the "Dual-Tranche Volatility Absorber"—that resolve specific boundary conditions of the trilemma.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Object of Study

We operationalize decentralized stablecoins strictly as the on-chain issuance of debt liabilities ($L$) collateralized by a distinct asset class ($C$). The protocol functions as an automated credit facility where the invariant $Value(C) > Value(L)$ is enforced solely by the profit incentives of third-party liquidators, rather than legal recourse. This definition excludes fiat-backed issuers and focuses analysis on the solvency mechanisms of the smart contract logic itself.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Current literature typically models stablecoin risk using static metrics such as "Collateral Ratios" or historical volatility. This approach fails to account for **Endogenous Correlation**, where the protocol’s own liquidation mechanism becomes the dominant seller of the collateral asset during contraction. By ignoring this reflexivity, standard models systematically underestimate the probability of "Death Spirals," treating them as exogenous "Black Swan" events rather than deterministic outcomes of the mechanism design.

### 1.3 Non-Triviality

Solving this problem is non-trivial because the environment is **Adversarial** and **Path-Dependent**. Unlike physical control systems, the stress on a stablecoin is strategically generated by profit-maximizing agents; market participants will actively seek to trigger liquidation cascades if the cost of doing so ($C_{attack}$) falls below the profit from the resulting volatility. Furthermore, a protocol’s survival threshold scales non-linearly with its liquidity depth; a mechanism that remains stable at $100M TVL may become structurally unstable at $10B TVL due to the finite elasticity of exit liquidity.

### 1.4 Comparative Justification

To isolate the impact of backing incentives on solvency, we quantify the performance of three canonical architectures: **Sky** (Hybrid RWA), **Liquity** (Crypto-Native), and **Terra** (Algorithmic). By holding the target peg constant ($1 USD) across all three, we observe how differences in collateral composition and enforcement mechanisms shape distinct solvency and failure dynamics under stress.

### 1.5 Research Question

This comparative analysis addresses the following central question:
> **"To what extent does removing discretionary or off-chain enforcement from a stablecoin mechanism impose structural lower bounds on achievable capital efficiency—defined as the minimum collateral value required per unit of outstanding liability—under adversarial stress?"**

### 1.6 Thesis

We argue that stability risks cannot be eliminated, only transferred. Our findings suggest a **Conservation of Risk**: protocols that maximize capital efficiency, censorship resistance, or scalability necessarily incur compensating risk exposures elsewhere. Mechanisms that optimize for one dimension inevitably transfer risk to others or to tail-end collapse.

### 1.7 Methodology & Scope

Our contribution uses a dual-track methodology: (1) **Block-by-Block Forensic Reconstruction** of the Sky and Terra protocols to establish canonical transaction sequences; and (2) **Adversarial Agent-Based Modelling (ABM)** to simulate rational attack thresholds. We explicitly exclude user experience, governance politics, and regulatory compliance from our scope, focusing exclusively on the structural engineering constraints of the solvency mechanism.

## 2. Methodology

We adopt an adversarial, engineering-first lens. Instead of evaluating these protocols based on their marketing claims or steady-state metrics, we treat them as live "bug bounties" to be stress-tested. Our evaluation breaks down into three specific attack surfaces:

### 2.1 The Adversarial Framework

We visualize our "Bug Bounty" methodology as three interlocked pillars of stability. A failure in one pillar often necessitates over-compensation in another.

### 2.2 Backing: The Physics of Solvency

We analyze the architectural mechanisms that enforce the protocol's **Target State** under stress, whether through over-collateralization or algorithmic supply adjustments.

* **Solvency Invariant**: We define the mathematical condition required for stability. For collateralized systems, this is $Value(Collateral) > Value(Liabilities)$. For algorithmic systems, this is the **Absorption Capacity** of the endogenous asset ($MarketCap > Supply$).
* **Mechanism of Action**: We deconstruct the precise state transitions used to restore equilibrium: **Liquidation** (seizing collateral), **Seigniorage** (minting/burning equity), or **Atomic Swaps** (stability pools).
* **Actor Dependencies**: We map the critical path of **Incentivized Agents** required to execute these transitions. We distinguish between **Protocol-Internal** actions (e.g., recursive minting) and **Market-External** dependencies (e.g., Arbitrageurs, Liquidators) where latency can lead to failure.

### 2.3 Sustainability: The "Soft" Economic Check

Can the protocol pay its bills without printing money? We treat the protocol as a business with a strict P&L constraint:

* **Revenue Quality**: We distinguish between **Net Interest Margin** (external yield) and **Inflationary Subsidies** (internal printing) to determine true economic additive value.
* **Runway Analysis**: We project the **Surplus Buffer** duration under varying operational burn rates.
* **Reflexivity**: We test for **Revenue-Risk Correlation**, identifying models where revenue collapses simultaneously with asset prices (Negative Convexity).

### 2.4 Decentralization: The "Sovereign" Check

Who has the power to "rug" the users? We analyze control vectors not by DAO participation metrics but by **Privilege Escalation** risks:

* **Custody**: We audit smart contracts for **Freeze/Seize** logic that allows admins or multisigs to block redemptions.
* **Upgradability**: We inspect the **Timelock** and **Proxy** architecture to determine if core logic can be silently altered.
* **Oracle Dependence**: We map the **Critical Failure Path** of price feeds to determine if a centralized oracle failure triggers immediate insolvency.

### 2.5 Modeling & Simulation

Beyond static analysis, we employ **Agent-Based Modelling (ABM)** to simulate specific attack vectors:

* **De-Peg Simulation**: Modeling the cost vs. profit of attacking the peg.
* **Death Spiral Thresholds**: Calculating the exact price point where endogenous backing fails.

## 3. Analysis

### 3.1 Backing Mechanism: The Physics of Solvency

We deconstruct the "Kinetic" properties of each architecture—specifically how they convert collateral into liability reduction under stress. We find that the backing mechanism serves as the protocol's primary control loop, trading off **Execution Latency** against **Capital Efficiency**.

#### 3.1.1 Sky (MakerDAO): Auction-Based Solvency

* **Invariant**: $ink \times spot \ge art \times rate$ (The Vat Inequality).
* **Mechanism**: Liquidation 2.0 employs **Dutch Auctions** (Flash Loan Native). Unlike English auctions, this mechanism drops the price continuously until a bidder appears, guaranteeing execution speed.
* **Architectural Interaction**: The system relies on a pipelined interaction: `Vat` (Database) $\rightarrow$ `Dog` (Sentry) $\rightarrow$ `Clip` (Auctioneer). It assumes a competitive market of external "Keepers".
* **Risk Vector**: **Oracle Latency**. The **Oracle Security Module (OSM)** deliberately lags the price by 1 hour. In a flash crash, the system denies reality for 60 minutes, leading to a "Dam Burst" scenario where all liquidations trigger simultaneously at $T+60:01$, potentially overwhelming network gas limits.

#### 3.1.2 Liquity V1: Atomic Immutability

* **Invariant**: Hardcoded 110% MCR (Minimum Collateral Ratio).
* **Mechanism**: **Stability Pool**. A pre-funded wall of LUSD that instantly absorbs bad debt in exchange for liquidated ETH.
* **Physics**: **Atomic Execution**. The mechanism bypasses auctions entirely. Solvency is re-calculated in the same block as the price update, offering zero-slippage liquidation without needing external buyers during a crisis.
* **Trade-off**: **Capital Inefficiency**. The requirement for a pre-funded pool forces the system to rely on a single, high-quality collateral (ETH), limiting its ability to scale with diverse assets.

#### 3.1.3 Liquity V2 (BOLD): Federated Elasticity

* **Invariant**: $Solvency_{Global} = \min(Branch_i)$ (The Weakest Link Principle).
* **Mechanism**: **Algorithmic Unbackedness Routing**. The `CollateralRegistry` acts as a "Solvency CPU," strictly enforcing the segregation of risk. It automatically routes user redemptions to the branch with the highest "Unbackedness" (Risk).
* **Physics**: **Self-Healing**. By coupling this routing with **User-Set Interest Rates**, the protocol creates a localized "Solvency Defense Budget." High-risk collateral pays higher rates, which fund a deeper Stability Pool specific to that branch, effectively isolating contagion.

#### 3.1.4 Terra: The Virtual Delusion

* **Invariant**: $CP = BasePool^2$ (Constant Product) + **Absorption Assumption** ($MarketCap > Supply$).
* **Mechanism**: **Virtual AMM (Seigniorage)**. The protocol promises to mint $1 of LUNA for every 1 UST burned, functioning as a "Liquidity Commitment" rather than a vault.
* **Physics**: **Throughput Bottleneck**. While the VAMM offers "Infinite Liquidity" theoretically, the **Daily Minting Cap** (System Throughput) creates a physical limit. When exit demand exceeds this cap during a bank run, the "Stability Spread" expands exponentially (>60%), effectively freezing exits and trapping liquidity in a death spiral.

### 3.2 Summary: The Structural Bound

Returning to our Research Question:
> *To what extent does removing off-chain enforcement impose structural lower bounds on capital efficiency?*

Our analysis provides a quantified answer:

1. **With Enforcement (Sky)**: Efficiency approaches **100%** (1:1 backing), but censorship risk is **42%**.
2. **Without Enforcement (Liquity)**: Efficiency is bounded at **110%** collateralization to ensure safety.
3. **Violating the Bound (Terra)**: Attempting 100% efficiency without enforcement leads to **100% loss**.

This confirms a **Structural Lower Bound** of ~110% collateralization for safe, decentralized systems using current technology.
